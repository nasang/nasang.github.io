Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at the [Meta Platforms, Inc](https://www.meta.com/) in Seattle, where I work on the intersection of Ads, AI / ML, and privacy.

At Meta, I have built systems and infrastructure supporting multiple products, including [Ads GenAI Transparency](https://www.meta.com/help/artificial-intelligence/How-ai-generated-images-in-ads-are-identified-and-labeled-on-Meta/?srsltid=AfmBOorgHv6vEs3x8fTVFI-KSbyRex02PKqPkWqYA4M0Iakw4P-BePV3) and [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/ads/). I also have contributed to ensuring the privacy compliance of features used in Ads ranking models, from feature authoring to model training. 

Before starting my career in the industry, I earned a Master's degree in *Computer Science* from the [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), and a Bachelor's degree in *Information and Computing Science* from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).

As an engineer, I am broadly interested in all aspects of computer science, and particularly in large-scale systems and artificial intelligence. I expertise on infra/back-end/full-stack development.
