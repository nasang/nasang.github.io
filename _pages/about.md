Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at the [Meta Platforms, Inc](https://www.meta.com/) in Seattle, where I work on the intersection of Ads, AI / ML, and privacy. I have built systems and infrastructure supporting multiple products, including [Ads GenAI Transparency](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/02/gen-ai-transparency-metas-ads-products/) and [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/ads/). I also have contributed to ensuring the privacy compliance of features used in Ads ranking models, from feature authoring to model training. 

As an engineer, I am broadly interested in all aspects of computer science, and particularly in large-scale systems and artificial intelligence. I expertise on infra/back-end/full-stack development.

Before starting my career in the industry, I earned a Master's degree in *Computer Science* from the [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) in 2023, and a Bachelor's degree in *Information and Computing Science* from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) in 2020.
