Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Meta Platforms, Inc](https://www.meta.com/), based in Bellevue, WA. I work on Ads Infrastructure and Ranking, with a focus on data and feature efficiency. I also have experience building privacy-first ad delivery systems that balance performance, scalability, and regulatory compliance.

Iâ€™ve been interested in programming since I was a teenager, and that early curiosity gradually grew into a long-term passion for computer science. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a particular interest and expertise in infrastructure and machine learning systems. I enjoy working on large-scale, reliable platforms that support intelligent, data-driven applications, and Iâ€™m especially drawn to the intersection of system performance and model effectiveness.

Before starting my industry career, I earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information and Computing Science from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).
